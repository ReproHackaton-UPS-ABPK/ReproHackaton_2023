# ReproHackaton_UPS_ABPK

This repository is dedicated to the final project of the "ReproHackaton" course at the Paris Saclay University (Computer Science Grad School) as part of the Master's Deegre in Bioinformatics.
Some info about this project and course here: [Reprohackathons: promoting reproducibility in bioinformatics through training](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad227).

We'll be working of the reproduction of the paper: [Intracellular Staphylococcus aureus persisters upon antibiotic exposure](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-15966-7).
